# SuperLeafletMarioMap
LeafLet map based on Super Mario Styling using Mapbox

This site uses the leaflet library and a mapstyle imported from Mapbox and designed in Mapbox Studio. The map displays icons, a polygon, and is clickable (returning the longitude, latitude of the clicked point). With geolocation, the user's location is marked.
